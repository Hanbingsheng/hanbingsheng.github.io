intro: |
  Quitter is a Mac app that automatically hides or quits apps after periods of inactivity, inspired by my Automatic Social
  Discipline method. It’s great for minimizing distraction from social apps like Twitter and Slack, news readers, or even 
  your email app. —— Macro Arment

      <b>Original Icon</b>

      The original icon concept is simple, the logo part is a combination of command symbol "⌘" and a character "Q", which 
      is the shortcut for "Quit this app" on MacOS.

      <b>Redesign</b>

      Quitter is a timer for app to quit, that's the idea of the redesign icon. For the color part, I picked black instead 
      of red as the theme color, because red is a strong color which can arise impulse and passion, which is against the 
      app's purpose "reducing distraction".
