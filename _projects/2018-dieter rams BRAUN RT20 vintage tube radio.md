intro: |
  The Dieter Rams BRAUN RT20 vintage tube radio is a remarkable example of
  mid-century modern design. Created by the legendary industrial designer Dieter
  Rams in the 1960s, the RT20 embodies Rams' ten principles of good design, 
  blending functionality with simplicity and elegance. This iconic piece 
  features a sleek, minimalist aesthetic with clean lines and intuitive 
  controls, showcasing the timeless appeal of Rams' design philosophy. 

  I am very fond of this piece and have tried to draw it in Photoshop.
