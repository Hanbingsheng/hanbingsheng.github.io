  The Mobile Cloud team is not very satisfied with the visuals of the header and footer images of their public account. They hope I can improve the visuals of the public account.

      The original design had some issues: 1. The blank space before the appearance of the Mobile Cloud logo was too long; 2. Visually, it was too cluttered and failed to convey the professionalism and reliability of Mobile Cloud. Based on these observations, I created several visual solutions, among which the animation in Solution 2 has been applied to the opening of the Mobile Cloud video channel.
